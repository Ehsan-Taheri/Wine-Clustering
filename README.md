# Wine-Clustering

## Explanations and Documentation:
Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering.
### Loading Dataset:
Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
### EDA: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis:
Display summary statistics.
Plot distributions of 'alcohol' and 'density'.
Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'alcohol' and 'density'.
### Data Preprocessing:
Standardize the 'alcohol' and 'density' columns.
### PCA:
Optional step to apply PCA for dimensionality reduction (mainly for visualization).
### Elbow Method:
Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
### K-Means Clustering:
Perform K-Means clustering with the determined number of clusters.
### Visualization:
Visualize the clusters both in the PCA space and in the original feature space.
### Evaluation:
Evaluate the clustering using the silhouette score and provide a detailed evaluation including cluster centers and the number of data points in each cluster.
